# SquareElixirSdk

This is an unoffical Square SDK for Elixir (at least for now).

This library has not been published and is considered in alpha status.

## TODO

**Tests:**

Only a few have been tested in `Payments` and `Locations`.

**Documentation**

About half of the modules are documented. Note that some of the context written in the docs are for Ruby since the docs are
directly being ported from [square-ruby-sdk](https://github.com/square/square-ruby-sdk)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `square_elixir_sdk` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:square_elixir_sdk, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/square_elixir_sdk](https://hexdocs.pm/square_elixir_sdk).
